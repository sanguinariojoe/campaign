Poland was invaded by Germany and Soviet Union, almost at the same time (the
former began the hostilities on 1 September 1939 while the later waited up to
17 September 1939. However, the relationship with both invaders was extremely
different. While German forces caused 5.7 million casualties, Soviet Union
caused 150000 deads. Such difference leaded Poland to join Soviet Union at
further stages of the war, even getting his own army, aknowledged by Stalin.
